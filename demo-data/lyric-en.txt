[Intro]
(Atmospheric synthesizer swells with a steady beat)

[Verse 1]
Electric rain is falling on the street
To the rhythm of our tired feet
We’re searching for a signal in the dark
Waiting for the fire, just a little spark

[Verse 2]
System update, breathing in the air
Lost inside a world beyond compare
But I can feel the warmth behind the screen
A hidden beauty that remains unseen

[Chorus]
In this neon sanctuary, we are wild and free
Lost inside the frequency, who we wanna be
Close your eyes and let the colors take control
Feel the digital magic deep inside your soul

[Chorus]
In this neon sanctuary, find your own retreat
Dancing to the echoes, living on the beat
No more ghosts from yesterday to hold us back
We are moving forward on a golden track

[Bridge]
(Half-time tempo, spacey vocals)
Data streams, silver dreams.
Connect the dots, break the locks.
We are the pulse.

[Chorus]
In this neon sanctuary, we are wild and free
Lost inside the frequency, who we wanna be
Close your eyes and let the colors take control
Feel the digital magic deep inside your soul

[Outro]
(Glitchy synth effects fading)
Stay in the light.
In the sanctuary.
(Deep silence)
[End]
